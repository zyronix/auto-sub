Thank you for choosing AutoSub! The automated python subtitle downloader for Bierdopje.com.

Many thanks for the administrators of Bierdopje.com to expose and facilitate the API's and 
RSS feeds so that we lazy users can enjoy automated scripts like this.

Easy and straightforward script that scans your TV contents. 
If no SRT found it will attempt to download one from Bierdopje.com. 
Where the script will attempt to match the correct version of the subtitle with the file located on the disk. 
If not found it will monitor the Bierdopje RSS feeds for a new release. 
Once every day it will do a full rescan of your local content versus the Bierdopje API.
